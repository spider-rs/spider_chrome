//! Background cleanup worker for Drop-time async work.
//!
//! Certain RAII guards in this crate (`content_stream::Sink`,
//! `cache::stream::StreamGuard`, `cache::stream::ChunkSink`) need to do
//! async work at Drop time — removing a temp file, closing a CDP
//! IO-stream handle. Calling `tokio::spawn` directly from `Drop` is
//! dangerous:
//!
//! * It panics if the current thread is outside a tokio runtime
//!   (panic unwind, sync destructor, post-shutdown).
//! * A panicking `Drop` during an existing unwind aborts the process.
//! * Every Drop call has to re-check `Handle::try_current()`.
//!
//! This module follows the same shape as [`crate::runtime_release`]:
//! a single long-lived background task owns an unbounded mpsc
//! receiver, and every `Drop` site becomes a wait-free
//! `UnboundedSender::send`. The Drop thread does not need a runtime,
//! cannot panic on the hot path, and performs no syscalls beyond one
//! atomic load + one lock-free mpsc push.
//!
//! # Lock-freedom
//!
//! | operation           | primitive                                                |
//! | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
//! | [`submit`]          | `OnceLock::get()` + `UnboundedSender::send` (lock-free)  |
//! | [`init_worker`]     | `OnceLock::get()` fast-path; `get_or_init` only once     |
//! | dispatcher loop     | `rx.recv_many()` (batch drain) + one `tokio::spawn` per batch |
//! | cleanup execution   | `FuturesUnordered` on the batch worker polls all tasks concurrently |
//!
//! # Batched receive and batched spawn
//!
//! The dispatcher drains up to [`DISPATCH_BATCH`] tasks per wake via
//! `rx.recv_many(..)` instead of one `rx.recv()` per task. Under a
//! burst (many pages dropping streams simultaneously) this collapses
//! N future-park/wake cycles into one.
//!
//! Each drained batch is handed to **one** `tokio::spawn`'d batch
//! worker that drives a `FuturesUnordered` of all the batch's
//! cleanups concurrently. For a full batch this is a **64× reduction
//! in spawn count** versus spawning each task individually, while
//! preserving concurrency:
//!
//! * Inside the batch, `FuturesUnordered` polls every cleanup future;
//!   when any future `.await`s on I/O, polling yields to the next.
//! * The kernel I/O driver (epoll/kqueue + tokio's reactor) handles
//!   `tokio::fs::remove_file` and CDP `send_command` I/O in parallel
//!   across all runtime worker threads — the parallelism is in the
//!   I/O layer, not the task layer, so a single batch worker thread
//!   is not a bottleneck for I/O-bound cleanup.
//! * Multiple batch workers still run concurrently on different
//!   worker threads — the dispatcher spawns a fresh batch worker
//!   whenever new tasks accumulate, and the runtime distributes them.
//!
//! If one cleanup in a batch panics, the batch worker dies but every
//! other batch worker is unaffected (tokio::spawn contains panics).
//! The dispatcher itself is strictly a `rx.recv_many + spawn` loop
//! and never `.await`s on cleanup work — a hung cleanup cannot block
//! it.
//!
//! # True parallelism
//!
//! Each cleanup task is dispatched on its own `tokio::spawn` rather
//! than multiplexed through a single worker's `join_all`. On a
//! multi-threaded runtime the scheduler distributes tasks across
//! worker threads, so N independent cleanups complete in `~max(T_i)`
//! wall-clock rather than `~Σ T_i`. Critically, one slow cleanup
//! (e.g. a CDP close that hangs against a dying WebSocket) cannot
//! block the dispatcher from picking up subsequent tasks — the
//! dispatcher's loop body is `let task = rx.recv().await; tokio::spawn(run(task));`
//! and returns to `recv` immediately.
//!
//! # Deadlock-freedom
//!
//! * Submitters never `.await` and never touch a lock another task holds.
//! * The dispatcher's only wait is `rx.recv().await`, which parks on
//!   tokio's lock-free `Notify` and wakes on any push.
//! * Spawned cleanup tasks hold no cross-task locks; each one awaits
//!   only its own I/O (`tokio::fs::remove_file`) or its own CDP
//!   command future (`page.execute(..)`).
//! * A panic in any cleanup task is contained by `tokio::spawn` and
//!   does not affect the dispatcher or other in-flight cleanups.
//! * If the dispatcher itself exits (e.g. runtime shutdown), `submit`
//!   continues to succeed (unbounded mpsc send does not require a
//!   live receiver). Pending tasks leak silently — strictly safer
//!   than aborting.
//!
//! # Initialisation
//!
//! [`init_worker`] must be called once from inside a tokio runtime
//! context, typically on the hot path of any entry point that might
//! later produce cleanup tasks. Subsequent calls are a single atomic
//! load and a no-op. If a Drop fires before the worker has been
//! initialised, [`submit`] silently drops the task — no panic, no
//! deadlock, just deferred or skipped cleanup.
