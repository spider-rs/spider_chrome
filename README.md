# spider_chrome

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/spider_chrome/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/spider_chrome)

A concurrent high-level API to control Chrome or Firefox over the DevTools Protocol.

This project is a fork of [chromiumoxide](https://github.com/mattsse/chromiumoxide) that primarily keeps CDP up to date, applies bug fixes, improves emulation, performance, and enables high-concurrency CDP capabilities.

## Usage

```rust
use futures::StreamExt;

use chromiumoxide::browser::{Browser, BrowserConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    
   // create a `Browser` that spawns a `chromium` process running with UI (`with_head()`, headless is default) 
   // and the handler that drives the websocket etc.
    let (mut browser, mut handler) =
        Browser::launch(BrowserConfig::builder().with_head().build()?).await?;
    
   // spawn a new task that continuously polls the handler
    let handle = tokio::task::spawn(async move {
        while let Some(h) = handler.next().await {
            if h.is_err() {
                break;
            }
        }
    });
    
   // create a new browser page and navigate to the url
    let page = browser.new_page("https://en.wikipedia.org").await?;
    
   // find the search bar type into the search field and hit `Enter`,
   // this triggers a new navigation to the search result page
   page.find_element("input#searchInput")
           .await?
           .click()
           .await?
           .type_str("Rust programming language")
           .await?
           .press_key("Enter")
           .await?;

   let html = page.wait_for_navigation().await?.content().await?;
   
    browser.close().await?;
    let _ = handle.await;
    Ok(())
}
```

The current API still lacks some functionality, but the [`Page::execute`](src/page.rs) function allows sending all `chromiumoxide_types::Command` types (see [Generated Code](README.md#generated-code)). Most `Element` and `Page` functions are basically just simplified command constructions and combinations, like `Page::pdf`:

```rust
pub async fn pdf(&self, params: PrintToPdfParams) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
     let res = self.execute(params).await?;
     Ok(base64::decode(&res.data)?)
 }
```

If you need something else, the `Page::execute` function allows for writing your own command wrappers. PRs are very welcome if you think a meaningful command is missing a designated function.

### Add spider_chrome to your project

`spider_chrome` comes with support for [`tokio`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) runtime. 

```toml
spider_chrome = { version = "2", default-features = false }
```

This configuration is made possible primarily by the websocket crate of choice: [`tokio-tungstenite`](https://github.com/snapview/tokio-tungstenite/tree/master).

## Generated Code

The [`chromiumoxide_pdl`](chromiumoxide_pdl) crate contains a [PDL parser](chromiumoxide_pdl/src/pdl/parser.rs), which is a rust rewrite of a [python script in the chromium source tree]( https://chromium.googlesource.com/deps/inspector_protocol/+/refs/heads/master/pdl.py) and a [`Generator`](chromiumoxide_pdl/src/build/generator.rs) that turns the parsed PDL files into rust code. The [`chromiumoxide_cdp`](chromiumoxide_cdp) crate only purpose is to invoke the generator during its [build process](chromiumoxide_cdp/build.rs) and [include the generated output](chromiumoxide_cdp/src/lib.rs) before compiling the crate itself. This separation is done merely because the generated output is ~60K lines of rust code (not including all the proc macro expansions). So expect the compiling to take some time.
The generator can be configured and used independently, see [chromiumoxide_cdp/build.rs](chromiumoxide_cdp/build.rs).

Every chrome pdl domain is put in its own rust module, the types for the page domain of the browser_protocol are in `chromiumoxide_cdp::cdp::browser_protocol::page`, the runtime domain of the js_protocol in  `chromiumoxide_cdp::cdp::js_protocol::runtime` and so on.

[vanilla.aslushnikov.com](https://vanilla.aslushnikov.com/) is a great resource to browse all the types defined in the pdl files. This site displays `Command` types as defined in the pdl files as `Method`. `chromiumoxid` sticks to the `Command` nomenclature. So for everything that is defined as a command type in the pdl (=marked as `Method` on [vanilla.aslushnikov.com](https://vanilla.aslushnikov.com/)) `chromiumoxide` contains a type for command and a designated type for the return type. For every command there is a `<name of command>Params` type with builder support (`<name of command>Params::builder()`) and its corresponding return type: `<name of command>Returns`. All commands share an implementation of the `chromiumoxide_types::Command` trait.
All Events are bundled in single enum (`CdpEvent`)

## Fetcher

By default `spider_chrome` will try to find an installed version of chromium on the computer it runs on.
It is possible to download and install one automatically for some platforms using the `fetcher`.

Ther features are currently a bit messy due to a Cargo bug and will be changed once it is resolved.
Based on your runtime and TLS configuration you should enable one of the following:
- `_fetcher-rusttls-tokio`
- `_fetcher-native-tokio`

```rust
use std::path::Path;

use futures::StreamExt;

use chromiumoxide::browser::{BrowserConfig};
use chromiumoxide::fetcher::{BrowserFetcher, BrowserFetcherOptions};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let download_path = Path::new("./download");
    tokio::fs::create_dir_all(&download_path).await?;
    let fetcher = BrowserFetcher::new(
        BrowserFetcherOptions::builder()
            .with_path(&download_path)
            .build()?,
    );
    let info = fetcher.fetch().await?;

    let config = BrowserConfig::builder()
        .chrome_executable(info.executable_path)
        .build()?,
}
```

## Known Issues

* The rust files generated for the PDL files in [chromiumoxide_cdp](./chromiumoxide_cdp) don't compile when support for experimental types is manually turned off (`export CDP_NO_EXPERIMENTAL=true`). This is because the use of some experimental pdl types in the `*.pdl` files themselves are not marked as experimental.

## Troubleshooting

Q: A new chromium instance is being launched but then times out.

A: Check that your chromium language settings are set to English. `chromiumoxide` tries to parse the debugging port from the chromium process output and that is limited to english.
